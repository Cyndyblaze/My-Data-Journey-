 # My-Data-Journey

This is a summary of my journey through Data Analysis as a student with Incubator Hub. I was able to analyze and extract important information and make meaningful decisions.

With the help of the wonderful facilitators who have taken their time to expose me to a data-driven world, I learnt quite a lot about data, ranging from Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Visualization to Interpretation of data to ensure Data Integrity with tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I realized that data is made up of our day-to-day activity i.e, data is as old as man, and now, Data Analysis is one of the most highly demanded tech-savvy field, which I find very interesting because every data has a story to tell. Let me walk you through my data journey as I begin to unveil the story behind datasets while building my portfolio.

## Project Topics: 
Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis

This Project aims to provide RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon by analyzing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data is Amazon.xlsx, which is an open-source data and can be easily downloaded from an open-source online.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (for Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, and Data Integrity.
- Microsoft PowerPoint (for Data Presentation).

### Data Collection 
This is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest in a systematic way. It involves downloading my datasets from an open source.

### Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incomplete data in the dataset and duplicates.

### Data Manipulation
Data Manipulation focuses on transforming and preparing data into a useful format.

### Data Integrity
Data Integrity focuses on the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data. It ensures that data remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and retrieval. 

### Data Presentation

Data Presentation is concerned with organizing data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret by using visuals like charts and graphs.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is involved with exploring data to unveil the answers behind the questions, such as;
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

### Analysis

The above image is a screenshot of my dashboard, where lots of stories about Amazon products and their customers were told. With my excellent critical thinking and problem-solving skills, I was able to find the answers to questions on the pitch deck. My findings are documented below.

I noticed that some products have incomplete data; I replaced the missing data with "0" because the link to the products displayed updated information about them, which would be unfair to other products. Also, the products with the highest rating are mostly Electronics. This could be that Amazon is well known for quality and sophisticated electronics, i.e Electronics could be their product niche but, this doesn't mean that other Amazon products are not of excellent quality or do not generate much revenue. It could also be ue to increased discount as Electronics posses the highest average discount. Although high revenue could be generated from other products like: Home & Kitchen and Computers & Accessories. Also, products with the most discount have the highest rating count. 

Toys & Games provide the least or no revenue at all. This could be as a result of Amazon focusing on more on customers' choices i.e Amazon might not be known for selling kiddies things. 
Moreso, it could also be that the product is new andhave just been launched; needed to be advertised on different media like social media platforms and promotion of ADS to create awareness. 

I think Amazon should focus more on Electronics followed by Computers & Accessories, and Home and Kitchen products, as they have high total potential revenue with the most rating counts i.e, they are in high demand. As for those products with the least potential revenue, Amazon should take note of every customer review or create an avenue for feedback after they must have tested the products in order to know the areas that need improvement. Furthermore,  a reward voucher or promo like a "buy 2 products and get 1 free" or "refer a customer to us and get a 50% voucher to shop for another product".
