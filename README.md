 # My-Data-Journey

This is a summary of my journey through Data Analysis as a student with Incubator Hub. I was able to analyze and extract important information and make meaningful decisions.

With the help of the wonderful facilitators who have taken their time to exposing me into data-driven world, I learnt quite a lot about data ranging from Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Visualization to Interpretation of data to ensure Data Integrity with tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I realized that data is made up of our day-to-day activity i.e data is as old as man and now, Data Analysis is one of the most highly demanded tech-savvy field which I find very interesting because every data has a story to tell. Let me walk you through my data journey as I begin to unveil th story behind datasets while building my portfolio.
